        From October 10 to 12, 1912, the Rice Institute celebrated its opening
        with lectures by eminent guests from around the world. President Lovett
        proclaimed that he and his colleagues planned “to assign no upper limit
        to its educational endeavor.” With 77 male and female students and a
        faculty of about a dozen in its opening year, the institute quickly grew
        in size and importance, led by Lovett and James Addison Baker Jr., who
        chaired Rice’s Board of Trustees from 1891 to 1941. By the time Lovett
        stepped down as president in 1946, the institute was a key part of a
        booming city of more than half a million residents.
